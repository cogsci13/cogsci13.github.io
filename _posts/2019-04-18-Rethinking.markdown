<p class="intro"><span class="dropcap">I</span>ntroduction. Most cognitively demanding tasks require temporal storages of transient information, i.e. short-term store (STS). It is located between sensory stores and long-term stores, and used to hold and manipulate information for cogni- tive tasks as a working memory1. Though the dual-task study2 showed that STS was really acting as a working memory, the processing time and accuracy weren’t enough to account for working memory. As a result, it was assumed that the working memory is not simply a singular storage unit like STS, but made up of a few components.</p>

As a new approach, while replacing the concept of the STS, Baddeley and Hitch (1974) suggested the working memory (WM) model, and it has been successful in that it could explain non-unitary feature of STS and provide more specific explanation about information transfer between short-term memory and long-term memory. According to Baddeley (2003a), there are four components of working memory, and among them, phonological loop (PL) has been investigated rigorously, with related to various language functions and its deficits.

The PL houses speech-based information and the memory trace to the PL fades after about 2 seconds. Articulatory control takes written material and converts it into a phonological code to be stored and rehearsal can re-strengthen a memory trace before it disappears. All these processes are supervised and coordinated by the central executive (CE) unit.

But, how can we accept the existence of the PL and its role in working memory? There are four psychological evidences for the PL. First, there is a phonological simi- larity effect. That is, errors which subjects made in remembering letter sequences tended to be phonologically, not graphematically related (Conrad, 1964). Also, se- quences of phonologically related letters are harder to remember than phonologically unrelated ones, e.g. letter sequenceBGVTPishardertorememberthanYHWK R (Conrad and Hull, 1964). This was also true in case of phonologically similar words, and as a result, Baddeley thought that the PL is articulatory-based.

Not all similarity is, however, detrimental for recall. On contrary, some similarity may be helpful for recall, e.g. categorized lists and rhyme of words. This is rather confusing one in that both similarity and dissimilarity benefit retention. To solve this puzzle, we should discriminate similarity and distinctiveness3. In this view, similarity only interferes with recall if it leads to confusion between the items, i.e. indistinctiveness of each item gives rise to confusion.

The second evidence is known as word-length effect (Baddeley et al., 1975). When rehearsed, shorter words are remembered better. This suggests that capacity of the PL is determined by the temporal duration and that memory span is determined by the rate of rehearsal. Also, comparing same number of words but with different length showed that word duration is the crucial variable, not number of slots. Forgetting is the joint function of trace decay and rehearsal rate, and rehearsal is successful if it is faster than trace decay.

If the subject has to produce meaningless speech (e.g. ‘the the the’) during recall task with visually presented stimuli (Articulatory suppression), the memory would decline and the phonological similarity effect would vanished. This indicates that working memory encodes visually presented verbal material into phonological code, which is a role of the PL. In other words, inhibition of subvocal rehearsal keeps articulatory loop from refreshing information from phonological store. This is supported from research with patients with brain damage (Shallice and Butterworth, 1977; Vallar and Baddeley, 1984).

The last is an irrelevant or unattended speech effect. Irrelevant speech during presentation or retention phase of a memory experiment decreases memory performance, although the subject is told to ignore it. This is evidence that auditorily presented stimuli have automatic and mandatory access to a phonological system.4 That is, the qualitative nature of sound has an impact on accessing the phonological store and disrupting memory. The irrelevant speech effect showed additive effect, interacting with phonological similarity effect in auditory presentation of stimuli, which is not observed in visual presentation (Hanley and Bakopoulou, 2003).

In summary, a simple decay hypothesis can explain the characteristics of the PL. The decay in a passive phonological store is deeply related with an articulatory process, which determines the memory performance. Additionally, the verbal material presented visually has indirect access to the PL via subvocal articulation. In this respect, the PL as well as the WM itself is not simply storage, but an active processing of transient information.

Phonological Loop Revisited
Based on the above evidences, Baddeley suggested the structure of PL as shown in Figure2.

The major feature of the PL is that there is an articulatory loop to rehearse any phonological information. It may be confused by phonological similarity or indistinctiveness, but be strengthened by clear articulation. However, this can’t account for why the articulatory suppression erases the phonological similarity effect and the word-length effect only when the stimulus is presented visually. Also, under articulatory suppression, subjects can still judge rhymes and homophony of words. This means that there must be some other storage independent of articulatory rehearsal, i.e. phonological short-term store.

In short, word-length effect reflects a control process of articulatory rehearsal, i.e. long words take longer to be rehearsed, whereas phonological similarity relies on a short-term store that is accessible by auditory stimuli or by visual stimuli having been coded phonologically. Re- hearsal is not yet guaranteed in this store, and articulatory suppression weakens memory in auditory presentation and prevents phonological recoding in visual presentation. This functional dichotomy of the PL is well depicted in Figure2.5

Phonological Short-term Store
How does the phonological short-term store operate? Does it use lexical representations (words) or phonological representations (segments or syllables)? To resolve this question, we may use lexical and phonological distractors during recall task. That is, recalling sequences of digits shows almost identical performance under both phonologically similar words and auditory digits distractors, whereas it shows least disruptive performance under phonologically dissimilar words distracters. From this, we could assume that the phonological store operates at the level of individual phonemes or syllables rather than on lexical representations.

Then, how does the auditory verbal material have automatic access to language processing? The irrelevant speech effect shows the automatic access to the PL. And, according to Fodor, if any stimulus is meaningful, it is automatically accessed to the syntactic parser (Parsing is a reflex). The automaticity is very crucial feature of the PL and verbal working memory. But, how can we know whether one stimulus is language or non-language? That is, would the meaningfulness of the stimulus affect automatic access? This question would be critical issue with respect to exploring the current structure of the PL.
